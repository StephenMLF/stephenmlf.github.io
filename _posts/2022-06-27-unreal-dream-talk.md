# Unreal #6: VIPs Roundup

Talk from Oli at All Seeing Eye taking us through Dream and its many moving parts in Unreal.

Notes:

- DataProvider as an actor for controlling/recording all data; using Sequencer & TakeRecorder
- Offline Mocap system
- Show control over OSC
- MPCs for Materials
- Editor Utility Widget hooked into a blueprint actor for control over level sequences
- Unreal Sequencer has ability to 'trigger all intermediate events' so you don't miss keyframes when scrubbing

- UE Subsystems (like UE singletons)
- Interfaces also using Messages to communicate through interfaces without caring about whether it is implemented or not
