# ATCQ R&D Day #28

In order to drive progress forward, it seemed to make sense to forget about the fact that Lumen isn't supported in Scene Captures and try instead to get yesterday's objective of displaying content inside the grey box.

- [x] Reprojecting content from elsewhere in the scene through the projectors onto the grey box screens.
- [x] Made a blueprint which allows keying of switching the source camera that is writing to the texture the Projector uses.
- [x] Sequenced that switching at a Track level

Also spent a decent little chunk of time making the Blueprint that drives the Camera Switching somewhat intuitive to actually sequence so that it's not a massively laborious process to add cuts that match when cameras switch. Unfortunately couldn't find a way to get the active camera of a given camera cut track in a blueprint...

Then spent time with Nils and Maria on a call investigating the possibilities available to us for spawning multiple windows from UE and populating them with these Render Targets which led up to getting a plugin that does what we want which Maria might reverse engineer.
