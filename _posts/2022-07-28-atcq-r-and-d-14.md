# ATCQ R&D Day #14

Spent time learning some Blender by modelling one of the stores from the animatic I made yesterday and trying to determine any pitfalls with then moving it into Unreal. 

The main thing was material-ing it again in Unreal, and understanding that we think carefully about which parts required motion as they need to be exported as separate meshes.

This is the video of the whole thing in Unreal, with a pixelation shader set up on it to see what effect it actually gives.

We probably need to hone in on how this selective pixelation is going to be applied to get the results that we want, and camera movement in 3D is such a dead giveaway that this is a current gen game, and not DOOM.
