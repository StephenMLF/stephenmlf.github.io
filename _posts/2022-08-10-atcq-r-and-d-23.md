# ATCQ R&D Day #21

## AM Update

For Sebastian's Outrun-with-a-hooptie remake scene, I needed to produce some assets, so before standup I made modifications to my Houdini network for generating buildings so that each window would be randomly assigned one of 3 materials. 

This means that when taken into Unreal, it could be reassigned, and the buildings could look somewhat organically "lit".

I exported a bunch of buildings and sent them over to Seb.

I also ripped off a Neon sign generator in Houdini from [here](https://www.sidefx.com/tutorials/procedural-neon-sign-generator/) and modified the font and database so that we could generate some signage for that (or other) scenes too.

Finally, I began to experiment with adding an LUT into the UE post process shader, following the info [here](https://docs.unrealengine.com/4.26/en-US/RenderingAndGraphics/PostProcessEffects/UsingLUTs/).

To be honest, the effects a LUT can bring would be much better suited for reproducing effects like this, or cheap-ish tonemapping, but colour palette reduction and posterisation is not great through it. Here it is with some drastic alteration, just to see how crazy the effect could get:
