# Heartbeat Threads

### AM update:

From [yesterday]({% post_url 2022-03-31-pulsating-hearts %}): I need to fix this issue where _sometimes_ the C# seemingly causes repeated construction of the game client over and over instead of making one and working correctly. Is this a threading issue, given that it only happens _sometimes_?

I'll also only be working for the morning before going into the studio where we have a big Q1/Q2 meeting, so may not get masses done.

### PM update: Helped Nils with React at the studio instead.
