# ATCQ R&D Day #15

Huge day of calls so not much personal progress in R&D terms.

Helped Joy setup grey box, and helped Maria set up a particle system in Niagara for testing NDI streaming.

Then we had the creative update session, and in the evening I made some changes to the 3D character's camera to make it orthographic which has a huge impact on how the sidescroller reads.

A video of the effect can be found [on Slack](https://marshmallowlf.slack.com/archives/C03N2042J9J/p1659110445912049).
