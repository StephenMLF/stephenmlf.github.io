# Lateral Movement Testing


### Today

Lots of horrible testing trying to work out where jitter was coming from when moving left-to-right. This is apparently not present when rotating your head, but translating your position.

Went through headsets one by one with Nils, observed on some and not on others.

Tried to remedy by reinstalling ALVR on each headset and accompanying machine with seemingly some success, but it turned out to be a big fat hoax.

Much more information in Slack in the ["mega-thread here"](https://marshmallowlf.slack.com/archives/C0325K90HEE/p1652087837810679)
