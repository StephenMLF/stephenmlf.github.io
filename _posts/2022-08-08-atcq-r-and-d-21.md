# ATCQ R&D Day #21

## AM Update

Doing some Animatic to reflect changes in the thinking for the sidescroller in reference to [this Miro board](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVOgh4vGc=/) that Sebastian and I made.

This led to realise that we would need some Special FX in Unreal that would carry into pixel art.

## PM Update

Spent a good chunk of time building out a Niagara fire system that didn't work, then another one that did with our pixelation shader.
