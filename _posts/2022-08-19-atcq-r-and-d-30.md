# ATCQ R&D Day #30

## AM Update

Found a more thorough thread and managed to get Lumen working in Scene Captures in play mode. (there's also a description of how to get it to explicitly allow only for certain Scene Captures, but I think that is made redundant by having an option for what your Scene Capture is using for GI):

## PM Update

🗺 World Partition PSA 🗺

As we begin to develop more individual scenes for capture and rebroadcast in engine, we should all start to approach the project with World Partition in mind. Basically, everything we are going to do will exist in one Level (.umap) and operate like a huge hollywood sound stage complex. Areas that need to be captured will be self-contained little chunks organised in space, later enabled and disabled using Data Layers. These can then have their own individual lighting, actors, etc and we can avoid streaming sublevels or having issues with Sequencers not being able to access things buried in levels.

Things to note:
- Make sure 'Is Spatially Loaded' is set to false on objects (it's true by default) as we want to control loading with data layers and not e.g. player position.
- Make sure things like lighting etc are self-contained and will not affect other active 'soundstages' (if they need to be on concurrently) or the grey box
- Data Layer enabling/disabling will be handled in Sequencers


## EOD

(Finally) Running around watching some reprojections of engine content inside the Grey Box:
