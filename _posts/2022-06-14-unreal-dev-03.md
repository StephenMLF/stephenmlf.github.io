# Unreal #3: Build Issues, Version Control & Spatial Audio

The day was spent:

- [x] Helping Joy with issues she was facing when trying to build the Sweet Dreams VIP for the first time
- [x] This process led to getting Joy set up with Plastic, and talking about how to version control in git/plastic
- [x] Spent the rest of the day integrating a couple of blueprints that talk to one another to have an in-game button control the play/pause of a piece of spatially positioned audio
