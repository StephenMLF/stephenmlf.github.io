# ATCQ R&D Day #27

So. Long story short: there are issues capturing a scene to a RenderTarget.

Objective was: Play content within the grey box from a sequence.

1. Began by cleaning up entire project before adding more to it, which involved renaming folders so that they aligned with the Outliner names.
2. Also coloured all the folders so they matched the Miro board. Was able to push this to version control by following [this](https://forums.unrealengine.com/t/sync-folder-colors-across-source-control/345120/4).
3. Pushed back to `main`.
4. Nils pulled and had errors rebuilding `MlfSdk` when opening the new project. Spent a long time on call with him and Maria before finally discovering that he had some old redundant header files that could not be replaced. Manually deleted them and rebuilt and it worked. Location of the log files that helped us discover this is at [this link](https://community.gamedev.tv/t/could-not-be-compiled-try-rebuilding-from-source-manually/7953/25).
5. Set up a `SceneCapture2D` in the Unreal scene to capture one of the sidescroller scenes for reprojection inside the grey box, but immediately had issues matching the output on the Render Target to what was shown in the viewport.
6. After a few hours trying to use the controls on the SceneCapture to try to match the exposure and tone of the image to what was in the viewport, it became clear that the issue ran deeper.
7. Finally discovered that [Lumen is explicitly disallowed for Scene Captures](https://forums.unrealengine.com/t/scene-capture-component-not-capturing-lumen-global-illumination/249871/12).

Here's the difference between the out of the box camera vs the scene capture:

Viewport:

<img src="/docs/assets/images/atcq-r-d/scenecap_vs_viewport (1).png" width="600" alt="viewport">
</a>

Scene Capture:

<img src="/docs/assets/images/atcq-r-d/scenecap_vs_viewport (1).png" width="600" alt="scene capture">
</a>

In order to reproject what we are expecting to see, we will either have to manually capture a camera image to a Render Target or do away with Lumen (we don't want to do that).
