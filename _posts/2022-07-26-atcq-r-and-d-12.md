# ATCQ R&D Day #12

Recording a DMX sequence from a (virtual) lighting desk into Unreal, then going in and fine tuning the sequence itself on a per-channel-per-light basis with actual DMX numbers (0..255).
- On playback (and in fact in realtime), Unreal outputs DMX over ArtNet to any real world lighting hooked up to it.
- I close MagicQ in the middle of this video because I don't want it sending DMX in to Unreal anymore; it's done its job and so there is clashing DMX in information - instead it can gracefully pass the baton over to Unreal.
- **Save for testing whilst hooked up to actual hardware this is pretty much a full POC.**
- Also, since everything is going through Sequencer, I believe it also means we can jump to a spot between keyframes and it will show what we would expect right out of the box.
