# ATCQ R&D Day #12

Recording a DMX sequence from a (virtual) lighting desk into Unreal, then going in and fine tuning the sequence itself on a per-channel-per-light basis with actual DMX numbers (0..255).
- On playback (and in fact in realtime), Unreal outputs DMX over ArtNet to any real world lighting hooked up to it.
- I close MagicQ in the middle of this video because I don't want it sending DMX in to Unreal anymore; it's done its job and so there is clashing DMX in information - instead it can gracefully pass the baton over to Unreal.
- **Save for testing whilst hooked up to actual hardware this is pretty much a full POC.**
- Also, since everything is going through Sequencer, I believe it also means we can jump to a spot between keyframes and it will show what we would expect right out of the box.

## Houdini

The afternoon was spent investigating setting up a tool in Houdini to [orient geometry to face the centre of a sphere](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7CDHwgWKVo) for orienting city skylines to a globe for the creative on Award Tour, but then I kind of realised we don't need that...

It does however work with any input geometry so it can align to other shapes too, meaning it could come in handy for... something else.
