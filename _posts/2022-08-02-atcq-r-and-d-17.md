# ATCQ R&D Day #17

In the morning I updated my journal entries for the past few days, then moved on to setting up Unreal and beginning an audio reactive particle system that could be captured and projected into the fog during _The Chase Pt. II_. 

Had to go to the opticians and had an ATCQ staffing meeting, but managed to finish up basic audio reactivity for a Niagara system. It was quite irritating to try to understand piping a single Sound Cue through to a specific submix which Niagara needed to hook into in order to do audio analysis, but in the end I managed to use the default Master Submix instead.

A video and discussion of an issue I found with Niagara systems on data layers can be found [here on Slack](https://marshmallowlf.slack.com/archives/C03N2042J9J/p1659461689204829).
