# Unreal #2: Plastic, Data & Editor Blueprints

The day was spent trying to execute some things from the discussions at the end of last week:

- [x] Set up Plastic Repo for VIPs
- [x] Try to ingest some CSVs from Hardware management tool and;
- [x] Aggregate them within Unreal for export

---

The video shows what it could be like to have a project folder that contains the exported information about each (unique) piece of Hardware used in the project, meaning a table of used hardware can be exported from Unreal. 

Further work would need to be done to handle custom tagging in-engine of specific pieces of hardware for also exporting custom information such as the number of those unique pieces of hardware used, or in which room/area of an LBE they were used.
