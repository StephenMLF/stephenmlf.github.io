# ATCQ R&D Day #3

After yesterday's dabbling in making pixel art for the 2D platformer with an online tool, I spent some time investigating a more robust software solution for creating pixel art at the scale required for a 2D platformer level. 

Eventually I discovered Aseprite which is a fully featured and pixel art specific software. 

I ended up playing around in it to get to grips with the way it works and it seems like it can be both powerful and fast. And damn satisfying:

I spent some time trying to compile Aseprite from source as it's free if you do that, but ultimately just ended up paying for it.

This will obviously be a labour intensive approach if I need to make all the art for a pixel art platformer so tomorrow I need to investigate how challenging (or not) it is to set up the actual 'game' part of the ask - if it is simple enough the window for making the art will grow a little.
