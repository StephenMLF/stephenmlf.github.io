# ATCQ R&D Day #9

Today I spent a bit of time setting up the studio laptop with the Plastic repos and building Unreal so that I can start next week remotely with relative ease, then it was on to DMX.

Lucas had integrated the plugin that Patrick covers in the video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oIePxpasXk&t=3599s).

Got myself signed up to [gdtf-share.com](https://gdtf-share.com) in order to get GDTF files for our DMX hardware so they can be more easily integrated/set up in Unreal. Got a GDTF for our Clay Paky Sharpy... and they only had Sharpy Plus so the channels weren't right, and had to manually set up a Sharpy GDTF based on this.

After a bit of tweaking, we managed to get the DMX Output controller inside UE to also control our virtual light:

Lucas made [a video of the virtual light and physical light working in sync](https://marshmallowlf.slack.com/archives/C03NLDUAE5P/p1658417197381939). You can see the rotation is inverted in the digital world; this is easily remapped in editor as part of the device blueprint, but requires someone to sit down with the device and discover all the differences. Additionally it is worth noting that not all light functionality can be simulated in editor currently; worth bearing in mind when designing a show - i.e. if set up correctly, all digital will be replicable in physical but not vice versa.
