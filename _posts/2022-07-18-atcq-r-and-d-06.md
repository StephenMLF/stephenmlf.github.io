# ATCQ R&D Day #6

Spent time today experimenting with creating collapsing/rigid body destruction in UE5.

One option would be to generate all of the collapsing in another program like Houdini and then to export this to an FBX for Unreal. Spent the morning doing just that.

Fully baked in Houdini and brought into Unreal as FBX with animation:

            type="video/webm">
</video>

This method gives excellent control over the art direction of the destruction and is lightweight in Unreal, but the objects it creates are not collidable or changeable.

Another option would be to embrace in engine real time collisions. Spent some time setting this up too.

Fully 'destroyed' in the new Chaos system in UE5 on a static external model (fbx):

            type="video/webm">
</video>

Obviously this is a much more computationally intensive operation but the workflow is very simple and still surprisingly controllable (fracturing taking place within Unreal) with collisions on the resulting objects.

Another approach would be a kind of hybrid, where the definitions of the fractures are handled outside of Unreal and then used as chunks in Unreal. This was previously possible with Apex Destructions which is deprecated in UE5.
