Started putting this site together in order to record a proper journal of work. This is a post that has info I can refer to when updating posts in the future.

There's some more info below 🍕 :

You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight python %}
class my_object:
    def __init__(name, flavour):
        self.name = name
        self.flavour = flavour

    def print_flavour():
        print(self.flavour)

{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight csharp %}
using Newtonsoft.JSON

void do_something(string s){
    Console.WriteLine(s)
}
{% endhighlight %}
