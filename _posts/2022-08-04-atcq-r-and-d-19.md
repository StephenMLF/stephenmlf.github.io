# ATCQ R&D Day #19

Spent most of the day having major frustrations trying to figure out how we could spoof timecode to have our project run when not receiving a timecode input.

Eventually this was somewhat resolved for me by [this bit of documentation](https://docs.unrealengine.com/4.27/en-US/AnimatingObjects/Sequencer/Overview/ReferenceEditor/SequencerToolbarReference/) (under 'Clock Source').

Essentially we can just set the clock source of our master sequence to be 'Relative Timecode' and set the project's timecode source to be system time.

Spent a bit of time setting up a Game Mode that would mean that we could automatically play/control the master sequence, and then set up a hierarchy of sequencing for 8M Stories and populated it.
