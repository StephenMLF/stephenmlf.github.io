# ATCQ R&D Day #22

## AM Update

Before standup I consolidated the previous days' work into a rigged character (Iron Man) who was on fire with a Niagara system, this time a 2D movable fire system.

Mostly, this was an exercise in seeing how difficult it would be to turn one of the storyboard ideas into a reality. 

Actually, the process was relatively smooth, and given we could be joined by Joaquina who could handle some modelling and rigging tasks, I think the current ideas for the animatic are doable!

## PM Update

Big conversation with Sebastian about how to internally art direct the rest of the sidescroller for the interim period before September.

Needed to work on the second half of the animatic overview (there's a big missing middle chunk) so worked in sketchbook and then lined up all the scans in Adobe Animate with the rest of it.

It's now very rough but at least provides a brief overview of the plan for each segment in a way that can be worked from:
