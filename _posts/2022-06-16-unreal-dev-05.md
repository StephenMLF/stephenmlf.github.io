# Unreal #5: Bouncy Balls and Chairs

Starting from yesterday, went back a step to understand the 'bounciness' system separate from the attaching to a mesh system, which was pretty helpful:

[This tutorial helped to understand simulating the effect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn248ntS2j8), albeit in an older Unreal that had things I don't in UE5 and vice versa.

[My version is here](https://marshmallowlf.slack.com/archives/C01LR3113QC/p1655378861036199), but I didnt bother with the colours.

Then, at the end of the day, and with much hassle, I managed to rework yesterday's mesh particles into this system.

[Here is a video, and a thread ](https://marshmallowlf.slack.com/archives/C01LR3113QC/p1655396782978419) where I talk about some of the issues associated with using an underlying mesh. Tomorrow I'm hoping to work on getting the reprojecting of these deformations into a render texture that means I can add World Position Offset to the materials of my mesh. I probably also need a better mesh with UVs, so I need make the number of particles the system uses parametric.
