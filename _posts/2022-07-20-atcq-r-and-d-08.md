# ATCQ R&D Day #8

Today, before our Replication 101 talk with Lucas & Maria, I started to look more concretely at the idea of using 3D over 2D in our sidescroller, with the goal of having a faster workflow. There was another goal, too, to sequence an animation of the sidescroller to (a) see how easy it is, and (b) set up a sequence that can be triggered from elsewhere (e.g. a server). 

## The argument for 3D

In order for things to be faster, I identified where in the work so far the bottlenecks had been:

- Generating buildings/a city/backgrounds in pixel art for moving through
- Character design
  - Character animation design and drawing
- Hand painting lighting onto sprites in layers

... basically anything hand-drawn is subject to enormous lead times whenever a change arises, and some of the above is standing in the way of actually developing quickly.

One of the critical things that needs to be possible is having a variety animations for our characters, and for them to be iterable. With a small team and a short timeframe we need to work out how this can be done fast.

If we move to 3D, we can leverage the following:

- [x] Generating buildings/a city/backgrounds in pixel art for moving through
  - 3D packages can be used (as yesterday) to procedurally make a lot of varied content fast
- [ ] Character design
  - This still takes time, but should really be the main task in terms of lookdev/narrative
      - [x] Character animation design and drawing
        - Not only can we use placeholder animations for development, but animations can be tweaked independently from characters, and reused between characters with the same skeleton
- [x] Hand painting lighting onto sprites in layers
  - Lighting is 'out-of-the-box' in that we just place lights where we want them in the scene, instead of drawing anything; also more dynamic

These are some pretty winning arguments, so it's time to see what we can make, fast.

## Repurposing/retargeting animations

Firstly, setting up a sequence with character animations is trivial, but it should be noted that these animations aren't taking place on a playable character but rather a simple mesh that can accomodate animation clips, as per the documentation [here](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.0/en-US/how-to-add-cinematic-animation-to-a-character-in-unreal-engine/).

This is a fully hand-drawn sequence for the above to work, but a completely different workflow could be employed by possessing the character as usual and [using Take Recorder to record into Sequencer](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.0/en-US/record-gameplay-in-unreal-engine/). 

These animations are all built in Unreal animations, and whilst they work nice and smoothly for the third person environment in which they were produced, they make our pixelation shader look exactly like what it is; a layer of 'blur' over a very modern engine.

With Nils, we came up with two different workflows to modify these animations:

1. Working with a Blender Plugin called [Mr Mannequins Tools](https://jimkroovy.gumroad.com/l/MrMannequinsTools) Nils created a 10 frame run cycle from reference poses where each frame lasted 3 frames, giving us a 30 frame crunchy run animation.
2. Having this plugin allowed us to have more control over Unreal-ready rigs so we exported an existing (jump) animation from Unreal, brought it into Blender and then re-exported it with the animation Sample Rate set to 3 instead of 1, so that it only gave 1 of every 3 frames, effectively downsampling the animation.

Whilst the second method is a bit of a kick in the teeth to animation purity, the effect these techniques both had were pretty clear:

            type="video/webm">
</video>

Comparing the run and jump animation at the start to the fall/land/walk animations at the end, we get a much truer pixel art matching animation, and the second method's poses are still tweakable, and the workflow is _fast_.

From here, we can collate a bunch of animations, either from Unreal, Mixamo, Rokoko or whatever for placeholder (or even actual) animations, downsample and tweak them and apply them to our characters.
