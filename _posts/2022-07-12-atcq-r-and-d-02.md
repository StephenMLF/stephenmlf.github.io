# ATCQ R&D Day #2

Spent the morning investigating things gleaned yesterday about the processes that could be employed in UE to achieve the idea of some kind of sidescroller.

Ended up making a little idle animation of some kind of Phife character in the style of Global Gladiators with a golden mic:

</a>

Later in the day, we had a proper kickoff meeting to talk about the up to date ideas behind each track's creative brief and to work out what we might like to each work on ahead of tomorrow.

Spent a bunch of time thinking about how to juggle the things I want to do on this project and how best to select tasks so that I don't run out of time to actually deliver them.

Took some time to experiment with the workflow of making a character that looked a little like Phife in Metahuman (they have pretty poor support for the 'five foot assassin's body type) in thinking about whether it made more sense to do the sidescroller as a 3D UE project with lots of postprocessing.

The reasoning for this is that there is a desire to not have the sidescroller be completely old school pixel art, but somehow bring in modern day video gaming techniques...
