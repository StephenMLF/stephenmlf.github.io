Big news followed by slow news day: ATCQ might be cancelled, so work is paused on it for now.

Instead, moved to trying to recreate Evolver in Unreal, as a joint task for me, Sebastian and Joy. 

Yesterday was mostly taken up with getting a proper VR project into a new repository, with World partition, OFPA and other bits and pieces enabled so we could work together on it.
