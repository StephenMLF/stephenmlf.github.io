# ATCQ R&D Day #33

## Basketball

In the absence of readily available motion capture for free, I began scouring for someone else's basketball mocap to try out mocking up an NBA Jam style vignette for 8M stories. Rokoko, Mixamo, Daz and others seemed to have very few offerings when it came to basketball, but I eventually found [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WS4PvncqDCw) which led me to [this link](http://www.mediafire.com/?o6ncxuu1oq5r6z9).

Also came across some partially broken bit of Python (for an older version of Blender?) for cbatch converting .bvh file to .fbx files from here:

{% highlight python %}
import os
dir = os.listdir("D:\\bvh")
pathbvh = ("D://bvh/")
pathfbx = ("D://fbx/")
for file in dir:
bpy.ops.import_anim.bvh(filepath=pathbvh+file, filter_glob="*.bvh", global_scale=1, frame_start=1, use_fps_scale=False, use_cyclic=False, rotate_mode='NATIVE', axis_forward='-Z', axis_up='Y')
bpy.ops.export_scene.fbx(filepath=pathfbx+file)
bpy.ops.object.select_by_layer()
bpy.ops.object.delete()
{% endhighlight %}

No matter how I treated those bvh files, I couldn't get them to play nicely with Unreal, so I moved on since this isn't the most important thing in making this vignette.

Instead I moved on to getting a setting, and programming some animations into sequencer. I ended up with this:

<video controls width="600">
    <source src="/docs/assets/videos/2022-09-02 18-07-21-1.webm"
            type="video/webm">
</video>

Without more animations/mocap, adding in other players, or even getting vaguely the kinds of animations we want to match the lyrics, is a real effort.

Also found these links ([1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_6LGyACVz0), [2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CcJv8V-M9zs) & [3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9q8A-9DvPo)) which may be helpful for quickly populating scenes such as the GTA scene later.
