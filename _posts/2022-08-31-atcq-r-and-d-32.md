# ATCQ R&D Day #32

- Spoke with Joy about how to go about doing audio-reactive vinyl scratching in Unreal, and gave her a run-down of the tasks that should be approached to achieve this.
- Spoke with Maria about resolving a couple of issues:
  - Firstly, we kept hitting the following:
  > ATCQ_MM could not be compiled. Try building from source manually.
  - This led us to discover that there were underlying issues with the plugins and their leftover content, plus how they were named had changed. After a 5 hour call, we successfully managed to both resolve the plugin issues and package. Details in Maria's journal.
- Began setting up Mario/Alice in Wonderland scene~~~~
