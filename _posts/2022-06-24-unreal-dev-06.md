# Unreal #6: VIPs Roundup

After a really productive week, we've had to navigate a huge amount of hurdles with Unreal and Version Control, and brought a Sweet Dreams VIP closer to a reality.

- Moved last week's Hardware Aggregation tool to the new Sweet Dreams VIP project
- Moved spatial audio triggering from last week to SD VIP
- Added more player controls to the SD Third Person for speeding through the level to debug
- Made 'Panopticon' interaction
  - Made video player for auditorium screen
  - Triggered random orb selection on video stop
    - This required logic to select a specific, set percentage of the orbs to be one colour, and the others to be another, but at random
  - Once orbs assigned colours, the doors light up in the two colours after a short pause
- Found out about the absolutely hideous merge conflict hell that is working with `*.uasset`s and `*.umap`s
- Made a huge switch over to working with Unreal's new [One File Per Actor](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.0/en-US/one-file-per-actor-in-unreal-engine/) method of working collaboratively (which seems to work best with Perforce, but implemented in our Plastic repo) and is part of their [World Partition system](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.0/en-US/world-partition-in-unreal-engine/) which replaces the UE4 idea of sublevels .
- Began work on the booth interactions, trying to create relatively dynamic blueprints for interactions so that components are constructed by scripts, and so that we can relink things as needed to the Datasmith model

Still really irritatingly stuck on our Niagara issue which stops me being able to assign a Render Target to my Niagara system; perhaps I can ask a question about it in our Dream workshop which we will have next week.
