# ATCQ R&D Day #11

Lots of meetings today, but around it, I managed to make [the moon and the earth](https://marshmallowlf.slack.com/archives/C03N2042J9J/p1658747606260059) in Blender (UV Spheres) with high resolution texture based materials:

</a>

and also get DMX _input_ working in Unreal, with the goal of discovering how easy it would be for a lighting designer to get work done on a traditional DMX desk into Unreal for previs and ultimately for show control via DMX Out:

In conclusion, it's extremely possible to record DMX into Unreal through Take Recorder. Read on for more...

> Above is a video of me controlling DMX using MagicQ, just needed to modify a setting inside it to make it send on loopback IP, and added a Sharpy (tutorial [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxliSWwjL6Q))
> 
> My video shows controlling DMX channel activity inside Unreal using this console. Next, channels would be allocated for the heads (e.g. 10x Sharpys) - in [the same way we achieved last week](https://marshmallowlf.slack.com/archives/C03NLDUAE5P/p1658417327398729?thread_ts=1658417197.381939&cid=C03NLDUAE5P) - and could be controlled using ArtNet from any device.
> Recording that input could be done easily in the following way:
> - Lighting Designer designs show on desk/software of choice whilst hooked up to Unreal to realtime pre-vis by hitting 'Simulate' or 'Play' inside Unreal
> - Lighting Designer follows usual procedure of recording the show to the desk itself by making their program and saving it as a file
> - Take Recorder is used to record the incoming DMX signal of the show by pressing Play in Unreal, pressing play on the desk, and making sure Take Recorder is set to record the DMX Library with all its configured heads (as in [this video](https://youtu.be/a3XLJFD-0KU?t=137))
> 
> Also, the final video linked shows a scenario where lighting 'presets' are recorded into Take Recorder using the above method, and then lighting design itself is done within Unreal, or final tweaks and adjustments can be made (the youtuber is basically just using each head's dimmer to x-fade between light sequences).

Now the challenge is to set up testing a full loop of that system and see if we can record something from a desk into Unreal to control a pre-vis and a real light identically
