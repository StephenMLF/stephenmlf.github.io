# ATCQ R&D Day #10

Not a huge amount of note today, other than merging the work of the last week up to main, which required fixing the RenderStream plugin.

Also spent a chunk both setting up and building the project on the studio laptop ready to work remotely next week.

Also a little EOD test to dust off the rust in C4D, I made an animated text test for the opening lines of Sucka N****.

Additionally, spent most of the morning on some ad hoc MOTF support, trying to dig up the latest information about EEE zones for Ersin to respond to the museum.
