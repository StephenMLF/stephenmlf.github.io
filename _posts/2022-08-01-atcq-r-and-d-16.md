# ATCQ R&D Day #16

Spent all of today either on calls, or doing some project organisation in terms of breaking down each track into its creative/technical asks on [this Miro board](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVOoqtOWY=/?moveToWidget=3458764530429002944&cot=14).

Then spent time turning those into Notion tasks for people to take ownership of [here](https://www.notion.so/marshmallowlaserfeast/a0e362750b9d44619c67a5434364dcff?v=f84b29caf35f47d4903027a912f51535).
