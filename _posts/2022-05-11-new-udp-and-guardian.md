# New UDP and a Guardian


### AM Update

Testing:

- [x] New UDP system integration
  - [x] New batch script to run `tracking_relay.py` instead of the now deprecated `boot_udp.py`
  - [x] Switching to new method in the patch 
    - ports are now `4200` instead of `420`, and `6666` instead of `666`, and these are specified in the MLFNetParams  
- [x] Guardian mode works with this, too!
