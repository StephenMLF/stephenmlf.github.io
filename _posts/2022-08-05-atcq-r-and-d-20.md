# ATCQ R&D Day #20

Spent the morning working on making and rigging a custom character for the sidescroller.

More info and discussion [here](https://marshmallowlf.slack.com/archives/C03NLDUAE5P/p1659699901914249).

Then spent the afternoon working on producing something that is a direct reference of the NBA Jam intro that could be used as an introduction to 8M Stories:
