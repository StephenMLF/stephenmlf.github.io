# ATCQ R&D Day #21

## AM Update

Objective: set up a sidescroller type vignette that proves our process to date is one that will work for creating these scenes in the correct style.

Worked up a character that we can hopefully reuse in multiple sidescroller scenes for the time being as Phife using Daz, made him a Knicks jacket and got him into Unreal with an animation.

There is a link to a video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5NW5TJnmz4) detailing a process for going straight from Daz to UE5 which is what I had done previously, but given that all the animation is due to be sequenced, I simply exported the full mesh from Daz (first converting everything in the Daz scene including the clothes from 'Figure to Prop') as an fbx, uploaded to Mixamo as a character and then downloaded a mesh with an animation. Since it is rigged with a Mixamo skeleton it should be relatively straightforward to download and add other animations for it from Mixamo.

## PM Update

The rest of the day was spent setting up a scene with minimal lighting, a 6° FOV camera, more mixamo characters, Quixel assets for set decoration and a building from an (again) modified version of the Houdini building generator. This time, I very quickly and dirtily added some steps to the front door of the building so that it worked a little better in terms of the composition of the shot.
