# ATCQ R&D Day #31

Pretty strange day of catching up with the team, Slack, emails etc after being away for a week.

Planned out and did _some_ useful things, though:

- [ ] Taking on putting assets in place for Joy to do the audio reactive vinyl scratching
- [x] Fixing some plugin location issues:
  - [x] Moved MegascansPlugin to `Engine`
  - [x] Moved MLFMultiWindow to `Project`
  - [x] Solved headache with Nils relating to `MlfSdk` causing compilation errors, meaning the project is unopenable
    - need to liaise with Maria & Lucas on this to stop it from happening
- [x] Supported Nils in getting MIDI control of Unreal working
- [ ] Will be continuing to flesh out vignettes for 8M Stories in the background with Seb
