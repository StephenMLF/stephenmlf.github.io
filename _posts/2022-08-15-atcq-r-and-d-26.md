# ATCQ R&D Day #26

Day spent setting up and outlining a process by which our sequences can handle messages coming through from the server, or triggering content, and documented the sequence hierarchy on [this Miro board](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVOoqtOWY=/?moveToWidget=3458764531283136623&amp;cot=14&fromRedirect=1).

Also investigated the best methods for capturing in-engine content out to a movie file; there seem to be quite a few shortcomings or confusing situations involved in just hitting 'export to movie' from the sequencer...

Began cleaning up 8M stories section of the project to merge up to `main`.
