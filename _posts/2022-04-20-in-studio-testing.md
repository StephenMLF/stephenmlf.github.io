# In-Studio Testing

### AM Update

Today's task will depend on how this morning goes, trying to set up and test multiplayer in the studio. If we get loads of latency, there may be quite a bit of work to do.

### PM Update

The testing went fairly well, but we ran into an issue where headsets were receiving the wrong streams from ALVR. Managed to get 4 streaming correctly, and 2 had mixed up streams and latency.

Spent a hideous amount of time in vvvv that was effectively one line of code in C#: switching users IDs to be IPs
