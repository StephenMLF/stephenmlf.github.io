# ATCQ R&D Day #24

## AM Update

- [x] Made a character in Daz for the Carvel clerk
- [x] Uploaded to Mixamo for autorigging and grabbing animations
- [x] Brought character into Unreal for sequencing

Useful tutorial on this process [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYOlKZdmQGc).

## PM Update

- [x] Made t-shirt texture from daz export 
- [ ] Tried to downsample the animation using Blender as before but it seemed to have a pretty limited effect, perhaps this is just because of the small amount of movement in this animation.
- [x] Investigated the lift in making a functional menu system for the planned Shop interaction (that could hopefully be reused for other interactions)
  - What I've built has some hardcoded stuff in so isn't yet flexible but could be made so relatively easily. It's based on [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXrK2ywouX8&t=615s).
  - The system I've made also required getting to grips with Unreal UI system in general
