# ATCQ R&D Day #29

## Engine Modifications

Turns out it *is* possible to get a Scene Capture to render to a Render Target with Lumen... as long as you're prepared to make modifications to the engine.

Followed some instructions [here](https://udn.unrealengine.com/s/question/0D54z00007Y4afqCAB/lumen-is-disabled-for-scene-capture-components):

- Modified Engine source (5.0.2) and commented out this single line
- Set up new project with some lights and Niagara systems
- Added a camera and matching Scene Capture (position & FOV), left everything at default
- Scene Captured texture perfectly matches the Camera view, Lumen works and looks great
- ...Press play and engine instantly crashes

After a lengthy process of debugging and discussion [here](https://marshmallowlf.slack.com/archives/C03NLDUAE5P/p1660813590059899), it was time for stand-up. 

It was ultimately unsuccessful and I wondered if it was a general lighting issue, since attempting to build lighting caused Swarm to fail, so I tried to rebuild UnrealLightmass to no avail.

Decided I could continue with other work whilst downloading the source of UE 5.0.3 to make the modification to a clean download and see if it made any difference.


## Multi-monitor output from Sequencer

Pivoted to working with Nils and Maria to try to get yesterday's work of getting Lumen-free Render Targets rendering through projectors onto projectors in the real world. This mostly just involved supporting them in getting it set up, and attempting to help work out why the project didn't package when Nils and Maria tried to build.

## Pixelated Shadows

Whilst waiting for various enormous downloads, builds, installs, and experiment setups, I did some extra work on the Pixelation Post Process material to selectively add some dithering-style variation to just the shadows in our current shader, and found a [few](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx_AvrZK3TA) [reference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KvUfnrHcqM) [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18U50KPdD2A) to work from now and in the future.

Ended up with something like this:
