# Unreal #4: After Unreal Soft Bodies...

Lots of Computer Graphics research today to try to get different methods of soft body simulation going inside Unreal.

Some useful links:

- [ ] Pretty much the answer: [Unreal Engine - Niagara fake softbody physics with static meshes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5mH_MaznTI)

- [ ] Based on this tweet: ['Trying to find ways to deform a mesh' - Ghislain Girardot
](https://twitter.com/GhislainGir/status/1495534724533608453)

- [x] Requiring me to know how to do this: [Static Mesh Sampling in UE5 Niagara Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MJ8YtEs5as)

The day finished with me able to make a Niagara particle spawn on each vert of a mesh (in a much more ordered way than the above video, using the particle ID) and further modifying the above tutorial so that the mesh can be moved in the scene and the particles will follow its verts, and their normals.
