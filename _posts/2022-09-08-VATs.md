## VATs & More

Found an interesting page discussing approaches for siumulating different bodily fluids in Houdini [here](https://www.katexagoraris.com/creating-bodily-fuilds-in-houdini).

Followed a VAT based workflow tutorial I found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ6gT1uvJJc&list=PLXNFA1EysfYn686NxzYbKxm845eOIwDPA&index=6).

After this, I looked into a method of baking animations which allows a degree of flexibility after the baking: point caching. I followed a tutorial from [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N2tPBTyHO4). 

Houdini has been linked up well with Unreal, and can export a point cache that can then be read inside Niagara. Since the point cache is usable inside Niagara, particles in the system can still have Niagara effects applied on top of them, meaning the 'heavy lifting' can be done in Houdini, leaving Niagara to do the rendering and other, lighter particle movement stuff (for example adding Curl Noise... or making interactions between objects and particles).

The drawback to this method is the weight of the point cache files themselves, similar to the VATs method. The `*.hbjson` file Houdini created for a system with (peak) 200K particles that lasted 10 seconds was **1.5GB**. Unreal still started to struggle when asked to render spheres (not optimised for particle rendering) but was lightweight when rendering sprites.

[Here's a bunch of videos](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1S1v-EnbmQIzL22m4apQofTgHojTaJYOI?usp=sharing) showing these approaches, and some further discussion can be found [here](https://marshmallowlf.slack.com/archives/C01LR3113QC/p1662639142592799) and [here](https://marshmallowlf.slack.com/archives/C01LR3113QC/p1662648683647209).
