# Unreal Source Build

A few things remained with the newly introduced Plastic repo for UE source files, namely adding an ignore.conf as per the article [here](https://dev.to/goals/working-with-unreal-engine-source-releases-in-plastic-scm-ihf), and actually building the engine.

Created a [big chunk of documentation](https://www.notion.so/marshmallowlaserfeast/Unreal-Engine-Source-Setup-1b337234c3054b2b8801648d39d0abc8) on getting Unreal rolling from our new plastic repository.

Began compiling Unreal for myself.
