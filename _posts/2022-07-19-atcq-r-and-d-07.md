# ATCQ R&D Day #7

Spent the first part of the day investigating the idea of using Houdini to procedurally generate buildings for use in the sidescroller, leading to the buulding of a network that was customisable and produced a series of buildings.

The idea was that if we can leverage a workflow like this, we can effectively and quickly produce buildings with a lot of minor variation in order to populate a level of a sidescroller. 

In order for this to work, the idea of combining 2D & 3D, or using exclusively 3D needed to be something that was viable, so I tested an export from Houdini with the existing Paper2D character and collisions worked well as long as I used the complex mesh,

Then, Sebastian made a Pixelation post process material which unlocked the idea of moving away from traditional 2D pixel art production :( (at least for the most part) and instead crushing the content down. So, instead we would be able to use created rigged characters and animation/mocap data instead of hand drawing animation cycles :)

In order for this to work, we need to understand some methods of producing quick/cheap models of our characters where detail doesn't really matter too much for them to be crushed, so I began to explore a Daz3D to Unreal pipeline, which might be useful in a few other scenarios too, to be honest (e.g. Lady Hip Hop)
