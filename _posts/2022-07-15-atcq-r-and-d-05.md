# ATCQ R&D Day #5

The objective of the day is to complete the tutorial I started yesterday inside the new main project repository.

Unfortunately, woke up to a computer that had turned itself off at some point overnight.

Set it building again and it had ~2500 actions to build, eventually opened and let me open the project.

Spent time with Lucas getting the project ready for us all to work on, namely renaming lots of stuff and then setting it up for One File Per Actor whilst i drew some sprites in the background and waited for the build to complete.

Once this was done, had standup and lunch and sat down to get to work only to discover the build of the editor I needed to make was Debug Editor, not Development Editor, so am currently sitting in another 2800 step build process drawing sprites.

Thankfully the project is in a good condition and is ready for me to make a trial platformer just to see how bad the lift is on getting something we want going. 

Also, Aseprite is excellent. Remade the Phife idle animation in it during these hideous builds and the addition of layers, blending modes and a proper program focused on producing pixel art makes a huge difference to the speed of work.

Interested to try it to make a few quick tilesets for producing environments once basic platforming is completed.

Finished up the day at very high speed before our DMX call and finally got to making a sidescroller inside the level:
